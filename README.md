# ID_Merseyside_website

Hi good afternoon teacher, am Nigel and together with me is Leon and our group assignment is called 'Merseyside'. For our assignment project 2 we have develop a case scenario of the theme 'Student & School'. We have plan and come out with a concept of a Campus school open house website, where student get to have a overview of the courses they are interested and to learn more about it. In additional there will also be information about the different school facilities and CCAs that are available for students. And of course there are many more. 


For now we will be going through the website and explaining what are the features we implemented and contributed together as a team for our 'Merseyside Open house' website.


index.html (Home Page)
Starting of with the Home page of the website, above it we have added the horizontal navigation bar elements, it used to helps students easier in navigating the different page such as like the Home, Course, Map, and About Us. Below it we have the image element tag where I have a short welcome message in the image to display for the students. Moving down, in order to display my text content, I have inserted a card element tag and above the card I have added a logo element to insert a picture representing the card.At the bottom of the content I inserted 'a href' element link that will be used to identify and access to another page in the site.

Having a neat arrangement in the website it's important, so I different information that are added into the 'table' elements to arrange my data into rows and columns for display.

For dislaying the Merseyside facilities, I Created a "row" element of 3 column and a short description, containing the different school facilities and activity room that the school provided for the students to used.

Lastly for the bottom of the home page we have the campus map. With the image & link element tag it will link student to the map page if they clicked onto the picture that is being displayed. With every bottom of the page in our website, it contains copyright data and links to our merseyside instagram. For now I will pass the time to Leon to explain more about the course page.



ITCourse.html (Information Technology Page)
So we have listed 3 different courses that are for student to check out if they are interested. Starting of with the Information Technology page where I will take you through the features that have been implemented. Starting of with a image with a course title in every 3 different courses page, it will then helps students to find the right page and not getting lost. 

Moving on with displaying the core module for 'Year 1,2,3' I have created a expanding grid. With this it could store and list the relevant modules for each of the year just by clicking on the Year1, Year2, Year3 column.

In the table that will be consisting of Career Propects, Further Studies and Course Overview. Given a suitable setting for the table, the style section is where I store the table setting such as like the padding ,border, text-align, width.

Next up for displaying of the past student works that will be learned during attending the course, used "row" element of 3 column, from the left to the right some I have inserted embed code from youtube and some are pictures. At the bottom of every videos or picture there will be a "paragraph" elements with a short description about it.

Moving on lastly we have the game section where bascially it will showcase students knowledge, and skills they learned and implementing it into the assignment to create a game. Having a card display to show each of the team members thoughts about the assignment development process.

A demo video will be displayed for student to watch and understand exactly how the game works. So that they could have a rough idea on how the game will be played.

There will also be some interactive buttons that will prompt student if they are ready to take on the game challenge. Below of that button there will be the 'Start Game' where student can start on the game. In additional there are some comments and tips that are listed by the student that have created the game.



ITMinigame.html (Information Technology Game Page)
Information technology mini game is implementing a game using javascript it certainly requires us to do sufficient research and brainstorming on how we should go about it. So me and Leon gather the sources and started working on it, with some references to online materials that allows us to have a similiar concept that we are creating.

We created a canvas game where student will control a green object and try to overcome and avoid the grey boxes floating towards them. With a instruction below it will allows stuents who play the game to have a detailed information about how the game should be played and operated. For now I will pass the time back to Leon to explain the 2 other courses that are created by us.
