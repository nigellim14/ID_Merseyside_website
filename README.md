# ID_Merseyside_website

'Project Name: Merseyside'
Hi good afternoon teacher, am Nigel and together with me is Leon and our group assignment is called 'Merseyside'. For our assignment project 2 we have develop a case scenario of the theme 'Student & School'. We have plan and come out with a concept of a Campus school open house website, where student get to have a overview of the courses they are interested and to learn more about it. In additional there will also be information about the different school facilities and CCAs that are available for students. And of course there are many more.

'Features'
For now we will be going through the website and explaining what are the features we implemented in the page and contributed together as a team for our 'Merseyside Open house' website.


[Existing Features]

index.html (Home Page)
Starting of with the Home page of the website, above it we have added the horizontal navigation bar elements, it used to helps students easier in navigating the different page such as like the Home, Course, Map, and About Us. Below it we have the image element tag where I have a short welcome message in the image to display for the students. Moving down, in order to display my text content, I have inserted a card element tag and above the card I have added a logo element to insert a picture representing the card.At the bottom of the content I inserted 'a href' element link that will be used to identify and access to another page in the site.

Having a neat arrangement in the website it's important, so I different information that are added into the 'table' elements to arrange my data into rows and columns for display.

For dislaying the Merseyside facilities, I Created a "row" element of 3 column and a short description, containing the different school facilities and activity room that the school provided for the students to used.

Lastly for the bottom of the home page we have the campus map. With the image & link element tag it will link student to the map page if they clicked onto the picture that is being displayed. With every bottom of the page in our website, it contains copyright data and links to our merseyside instagram. For now I will pass the time to Leon to explain more about the course page.



Course.html (Course Page)
Thanks Nigel. Now I shall be talking about the course page, as for the course page of our website, we have added the horizontal navigation bar elements which allows the users to navigate to the course pages that we have implemented in our website individually. Next, for each of the page we have added a image with a title that allows users to find out if they are at the right course page. Moving down we have a row tag of different courses that referenced each of the course knowledge being learned in ordered List elements. At any point of the time, if student are interested they are allow to encourage to click the button on the 'View Course' to have a clearer overview of the courses in specific.

Lastly, we have implemented a 'Hear from our student' section where basically graduated student from each course to explain the learning progress they been through in the course they are in. With that we implemented the row element and also added the 'image src' to shows our student in a image and a description beside the image about what they are taught and learned in the school. Now I will pass the time back to Nigel on the IT page.



ITCourse.html (Information Technology Page)
So we have listed 3 different courses that are for student to check out if they are interested. Starting of with the Information Technology page where I will take you through the features that have been implemented. Starting of with a image with a course title in every 3 different courses page, it will then helps students to find the right page and not getting lost. 

Moving on with displaying the core module for 'Year 1,2,3' I have created a expanding grid. With this it could store and list the relevant modules for each of the year just by clicking on the Year1, Year2, Year3 column.

In the table that will be consisting of Career Propects, Further Studies and Course Overview. Given a suitable setting for the table, the style section is where I store the table setting such as like the padding ,border, text-align, width.

Next up for displaying of the past student works that will be learned during attending the course, used "row" element of 3 column, from the left to the right some I have inserted embed code from youtube and some are pictures. At the bottom of every videos or picture there will be a "paragraph" elements with a short description about it.

Moving on lastly we have the game section where bascially it will showcase students knowledge, and skills they learned and implementing it into the assignment to create a game. Having a card display to show each of the team members thoughts about the assignment development process.

A demo video will be displayed for student to watch and understand exactly how the game works. So that they could have a rough idea on how the game will be played.

There will also be some interactive buttons that will prompt student if they are ready to take on the game challenge. Below of that button there will be the 'Start Game' where student can start on the game. In additional there are some comments and tips that are listed by the student that have created the game.



ITMinigame.html (Information Technology Game Page)
Information technology mini game is implementing a game using javascript it certainly requires us to do sufficient research and brainstorming on how we should go about it. So me and Leon gather the sources and started working on it, with some references to online materials that allows us to have a similiar concept that we are creating.

We created a canvas game where student will control a green object and try to overcome and avoid the grey boxes floating towards them. With a instruction below it will allows stuents who play the game to have a detailed information about how the game should be played and operated. For now I will pass the time back to Leon to explain the 2 other courses that are created by us.



CSFCourse.html (Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics)
For our course page about Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics(CSF), we implemented similar features across three different courses that is the expanding grid, that allow students to discover what will be consisting in the Year1, Year2, Year3 core modules for Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics. Next up, a column class table that display the CSF Career Prospects, Further Studies, and Course Overview. With what me and Nigel have learned previously in Cybersecurity, we managed to find some of our practical work we did for display purposes for the assignment on the CSF course and a short description about the image. Next we have the “Course Curriculum & Prescribed Electives”, so we have implemented a 4 column layout grid to show the display for the Cybersecurity tracks, Forensics track, Elective, and what will be discover in this individual course. Lastly, we have a section where student get to know what are the tools we used during the lesson and a explanation about it. In additional with 'a href' link to the official website for more info.



IMCourse.html (Immersive Media Page)
As for our course page about Immersive Media (IM), we have implemented similar features as the ones we have done for our CSF Course Page. As follows, we have implemented the expanding grid that allows users to interact and discover on which consisting of lessons will they be learning in their three years of IM Course. Next, we have implemented a column class table which displays the Course overview, Further Studies and Career prospects relating to IM. I have also implemented several 'img src' and 'video src' to place the Images and Videos that I have done during my IM Course, alongside with texts that elaborates each picture with a short description. 

Lastly, we implemented two buttons which will create access to the mini-game in the IM Course page and let the users to another page to play the game. We also used the table element for the 3 students who created the game with their names, roles, LinkedIn website profiles, emails and lastly their reviews on their process in making the game.



IMMinigame.html (Immersive Media Game Page)
As for the page where Nigel and I implemented the mini-game for IM, we implemented functions, classes, and alignments to create this mini-game and a game-over function upon losing. Below we have added in paragraphs to elaborate the game controls, instructions, and the backstory of the game. Lastly, we also implemented two button Tags that allows the users to restart the game or return the user back to the previous page which is the IM Course Page.



CampusMap.html (Campus Map Page)
With the creation of the Campus map it consists of individual building, facilities, food halls that are within the school premises for Merseyside students. In each row elements, a structure collapse feature is implemented students can toggle the plus icon between show and hide for the description content of the facilities. Lastly at the bottom of the screen it's a mini map displaying all the facilities that is located in the school compound.



AboutUs.html (About Us)
It's essential for messuring student opinions about our school facilities and anything that is related to the school. So with this feedback page it allows us to gain a better understanding of the overall student experience so that Merseyside could identify areas for improvement through this.

Student could share their throught through the given text field in the page. We created this by using Restdb with consisting of the collection name, message and email. Having to use restdb it's the easiest online NoSQl datbase backend for web and low code servelss application. So with what the student have entered into the field we could retrieve it in the restdb website. At the button of the feedback field we have also created a display table records showing student given comments for our campus with their name, message and their email.

With lottie with have created a animations and allow a more interactivity design on our website, with allowing users to know that our website is 24-7 refreshing new comment records everytime. 

Lastly, having a interactive website is important so we have implemented with a section where students will get featured if they tag us in a post in our Merseyside Instagram page. With the image embed link it will link to instagram once the student click onto it, bringing them to the Merseyside instagram page to view. With this Merseyside website we implemented it will allows student to find out the best and suitable course for them to study at in the school.
